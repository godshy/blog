## What is Cloud Native？
Cloud native is not a particular product or technology. Instead, it is a principle, a business pattern. Cloud Native is a term that describes the patterns of organizations, architectures and technologies that consistently, reliably and at scale fully take advantage of the possibilities of the cloud to support cloud-oriented business models.It is the combination of severals of best practices.Enterprise and developers use thchnologies based on Cloud Native such as CI/CD, container and microservices to achieve high availability, high reliability scalibility and lower Time To Market and delivery.


## Basic principles and conponents of Cloud Native
What can Cloud Native bring us?
- Speed: Fast introduction of new services
- Scale: Easily expand from hundreds of users to millions
- Performance: Optimized capacity throughput and resource utilization
- Efficiency : Low cost for both Speed and Scale. Automation, no-touch operations, legacy and new services, life-cycle independence for both Services and
Infrastructure

Therefore, target of Cloud Native is to achieve higher TTM and lower TCO(Total Cost of Ownership) without sacrificing service reliability and performance. Let's see what are the basic conponents of Cloud Native.

- Cloud Native Applications
- Microservice
- APIs
- Containers and container orchestration
- Other automating tools
- Cloud native friendly infrastructures(Public clouds，private clouds，mixture clouds)

之前提到过，云原生不光包含技术，还包括思想以及一些行为模式。我们来看下意识形态上的云原生思想有哪些。
- CI/CD 持续交付/集成的思想
- 高度自动化(包括CI/CD，同时还有自动化监控，数据处理与分析以及异常检测的能力)
- 积极拥抱开源以及与CNCF (cloud native computing foundation)开展合作: CNCF是一个开源的CN组织，负责开发与维护与云原生息息相关的重要组件。具体介绍及成员请查阅CNCF的[网站](https://www.cncf.io/)。

在这里总结一下，作为企业需要完全拥抱云原生，并且获得云原生带来的优势需要做到以下几点。

1. 拥有完整的云原生应用的使用环境和基础架构
2. 拥有自动化重复流程的思想和技术栈
3. 积极拥抱开源与云生态圈，能够贡献自己的代码等
